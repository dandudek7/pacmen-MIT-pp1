# Pacmen Factory
This is a simulation of a Pacmen "factory" where moving Pacmen can be generated at varying speeds.
Pacmen will collide with the edges of the screen but not with other Pacmen. <br>
## How to Run
Pressing the "Add Pacman" button will create a new Pacman. If the game has not been started, he will not move. 
Pressing "start game" will cause every Pacman on the screen to move.
## Roadmap
Although it's more complex than simply having them bounce off the walls, a major improvement to this project would be collision behavior for the Pacmen. I would have to add a collision box for the Pacman so that they can bounce off each other as well as the walls.
